# Exercise-Activity-DS-Project
ML_Excerise_Prediction - Practical Machine Learning (class # 8)

##Introduction
Devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit make it easy to collect a large amount of data about personal exercise activity relatively inexpensively.   One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it

##Project Goal
The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. Choose both the machine learning method and the variables to predict the variable "classe".
